<p align="center"><b>Print Date</b></p>
<p>This is the date that will be printed on the certificate. You can choose to print either the date the certificate was issued, the course end date, or the date a course activity was graded.  If the course end date is selected, you must enable the date range and set the course end date in your course settings.  If an activity grade date is selected and a user has no grade for the chosen activity, the date the certificate was issued will be printed.</p>
